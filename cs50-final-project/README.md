# TRAVELER 
---
Traveler is a simple web based application that allows the user to create, view, edit and delete trips. 
The application was built in Python using its framework Flask.

## GOALS
---
1. This is my submission to [Harvard CS50 2021](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) 's final project
2. Learn and practice CRUD functions
3. Pick a fun project that I can revisit often and build up gradually as I learn new stuff

# DEMO

## PREREQUISITES
---
- [Latest version of Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/)
- [CS50 SQL module](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/python/)
- [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

## RUNNING THE APPLICATION
---
It is reccommended to use a virtual environment for this app.
Python 3 comes bundled with the [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv "(in Python v3.9)") module to create virtual environments, which is the one I used.

### Create an environment
Create your project folder and a venv folder within it:
Mac or Linux:
```shell
$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

Windows:
```shell
py -3 -m venv venv 
```

### Activate the environment
Ensure you have the environment activated before trying to run the project:
Mac or Linux:
```shell
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:
```shell
venv\Scripts\activate
```

When activated, the terminal prompt will change showing (env) at the beginning.

### Go!
To run the application, type in the terminal:
```shell
python3 app.py
```

Now simply click on the local environment's link Flask has served you to go to the application
